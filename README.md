> [!NOTE]
> Hosted AI teammates are great until you notice where they live: on someone else's computer, running
> someone else's models, holding your files and logins. **IsnadiBot is the same idea, open source.**
> Your bots run in an environment you own (your laptop, your server, or a sandbox you pick), and they
> work through the Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, or Kimi subscription you already pay for. There's no
> IsnadiBot account and no IsnadiBot cloud.
>
> IsnadiBot started as a fork of an MIT-licensed project by [OpenCore](https://github.com/opencoredev)

## ✨ Highlights

- 🤖 **Bots with a name and a memory.** Each bot has its own instructions, engine, tools, and notes
  it carries into future chats. You can read and edit everything it remembers.
- 👥 **Group chats that actually collaborate.** Put several bots in one chat. The group's boss
  answers by default; `@mention` a bot to hand it the floor.
- 🖥️ **A computer of their own.** Give a bot a sandbox desktop with a browser. Watch its screen
  live, take over to sign in or solve a check, then hand control back.
- 📲 **Reachable where you already are.** Connect a bot to Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, or
  iMessage. Messages land in the bot's normal conversation, with the same tools and permissions.
- 🔑 **Bring your own subscription.** Claude, ChatGPT (Codex), Grok, Kimi For Coding, and OpenCode
  run through the built-in runtime. Mix them freely: a Claude bot can generate images with ChatGPT.
- 🔐 **Local-first, for real.** Chats, bots, secrets, and logs stay on your machine. Remote access
  goes over your LAN, SSH, or Tailscale. Nothing proxies through a hosted service.

## 🆚 IsnadiBot vs. hosted AI teammates

|                           | **IsnadiBot**                                       | **Hosted (e.g. Grok Bot)** |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Source code               | ✅ Open source, MIT                                 | ❌ Closed                  |
| Where your bots run       | Your machine, your server, or a sandbox you choose  | The vendor's cloud         |
| Models                    | Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Kimi, OpenCode, mixed freely | The vendor's own models    |
| Your files, chats, logins | Stay in your environment                            | Stored with the vendor     |
| Account required          | None                                                | Vendor account             |
| Fork it, extend it        | ✅ Plugins, MCP servers, or the code itself         | ❌                         |

## 🛠️ Features

### 1. Bots & memory

- **Guided setup.** Connect a subscription, say in a sentence what you want help with, and the bot
  proposes a short plan for where it will start. → [bots](docs/user/bots.md)
- **Two kinds of memory.** Chat memory follows the conversation you're in; long-term notes carry
  what the bot learned about you, its work, and its groups. → [memory](docs/user/memory.md)
- **Permission modes per chat.** Decide which actions a bot can take before it has to ask, from
  auto review to fully hands-off. → [permission modes](docs/user/permission-modes.md)

### 2. Group chats

- **A team in one thread.** Several bots, one conversation, one boss that answers by default.
- **`@mention` routing.** Type `@` and a bot's name to ask that bot instead. → [chats](docs/user/chats.md)
- **Silence watchdog.** If a provider goes quiet for 90 seconds, the chat tells you and drops an item
  in your inbox instead of spinning forever. → [silence watchdog](docs/user/silence-watchdog.md)

### 3. Sandboxes & computer use

- **Pick where work happens.** Local workspaces need no setup. Or connect E2B, Daytona, Vercel
  Sandbox, Upstash Box, Tenki, Railway, or Ascii Box. → [sandboxes](docs/user/sandboxes.md)
- **Watch and drive the bot's desktop.** A bot in a Daytona sandbox gets a desktop with a browser you
  can watch live and take over. → [computer](docs/user/computer.md)

### 4. Channels, voice & images

- **Messaging channels.** Give one bot a line on Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, or iMessage.
  On Slack and Discord it reacts to show it's on it, waiting on you, or done. → [channels](docs/user/channels.md)
- **Voice calls.** Call a bot from its chat in the web or desktop app: realtime with your ChatGPT
  subscription or the OpenAI API, or transcribe → reply → speak. → [voice](docs/user/voice.md)
- **Image generation.** Bots create images with the ChatGPT or Grok subscription you connected,
  whatever model they chat with. → [image generation](docs/user/image-generation.md)

### 5. Plugins & tools

- **Curated MCP plugin directory.** Browse, filter, and inspect each plugin's publisher, auth, and
  where it executes before you install it. → [plugins](docs/user/plugins.md)

### 6. Everywhere you are

- **Desktop, web, and iPhone.** Every client talks to the same environment over one authenticated
  WebSocket connection.
- **Remote access without a middleman.** LAN, SSH, or Tailscale, from a browser or your phone.
  → [remote access](docs/user/remote-access.md)
- **Usage at a glance.** Plan limits and recent model activity across all your subscriptions.
  → [usage](docs/user/usage.md)

## 🚀 Quick start

### Download the app

Get the latest release from
[github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/releases/latest](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/releases/latest):

| System                | File                               | First launch                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `IsnadiBot-<version>-arm64.dmg`    | Not signed yet. Open it once, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/IsnadiBot.app`. |
| Windows (x64)         | `IsnadiBot-<version>-x64.exe`      | Not signed yet. On the SmartScreen screen choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.                                                                                  |
| Linux (x64)           | `IsnadiBot-<version>-x64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` the file, then run it.                                                                                                                                     |

To run IsnadiBot on a server instead, use `install-remote.sh` (macOS and Linux) or
`install-remote.ps1` (Windows), both attached to the release. See
[remote access](docs/user/remote-access.md).

### Build from source

You need Node.js `^24.13.1` and [Vite+](https://vite.plus):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot.git
cd isnadibot
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
vp i
vp run dev
```

### 🍎 macOS app (Apple Silicon)

Install Rust, then:

```bash
pnpm dist:desktop:dmg:arm64
```

The disk image is written to `release/`.

### 📱 iOS app

IsnadiBot for iPhone and iPad is a client for your environment. Your bots keep running on your
computer or server; the phone lets you chat with them, check on their work, and manage settings from
anywhere. It isn't on the App Store yet.

You need a Mac with Xcode and an Apple developer account (the app uses native modules, so Expo Go
won't work). From `apps/mobile`:

```bash
vp run dev:client   # start Metro
vp run ios:dev      # build and run the dev client, installed as "IsnadiBot Dev"
vp run ios:release  # or build a self-contained release app, installed as "IsnadiBot"
```

<details>
<summary>Free Apple account, and pairing your phone</summary>

With a free Apple account (Personal Team), set `T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1` and a bundle ID you own
in `T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID`. That build leaves out the widgets, the share extension,
push notifications, and Sign in with Apple.

To connect the app, run `isnadi pair` on the machine running IsnadiBot and scan the QR code it
prints. Pairing over your local network or Tailscale works the same way; see
[remote access](docs/user/remote-access.md) and the [mobile README](apps/mobile/README.md).

</details>

### 📂 Where your data lives

Chats, bots, settings, secrets, and logs stay on your machine in `~/.isnadi`. An existing upstream
data folder is moved there on first launch, so your data carries over.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

IsnadiBot is a pnpm monorepo. The environment server does the work, and every client talks to it
over the same authenticated WebSocket connection.
