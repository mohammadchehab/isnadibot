# isnadibot

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#100](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/100) [`8b857f6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/8b857f6e7ec4cfe3939cb3d7085e976de3e80fa8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Arabic (العربية) is now available on web and desktop. Choose it in Settings → Language: the interface mirrors right to left at once, messages follow their own text direction, and code and paths stay left to right.

- [#121](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/121) [`ba13240`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ba1324027382325e4e0384d69426a658512973c2) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Bots can keep an ordered list of fallback models in their settings. The list is saved with the bot and shown on mobile as a count; turns do not use it yet.

- [#184](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/184) [`9383c87`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/9383c872009369695506c7ea28589ccd2adf8e4b) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Interrupt a working bot, steer it, or clear its context without leaving the roster. Each bot's row menu has Interrupt, Steer and Clear context, and the command palette has a Bots group that interrupts or clears every bot at once or opens one bot's chat with the caret ready in its composer.

- [#136](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/136) [`d17c968`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/d17c968c026e01273ca97ddf5a341f863c5a7c48) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Choose which skills each bot uses. Bot settings has a Skills panel with a switch per skill and a switch for registry skills, and mobile shows how many skills are on.

- [#206](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/206) [`ca3fdf4`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ca3fdf4170c59616a1052f9d187dbe76fefb1212) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A bot whose provider needs signing in now says so on the roster. Instead of reading as busy or idle, it shows **Sign in** in the capacity view and the space standup, and the count of bots in each state gains that total.

- [#148](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/148) [`d82aa9e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/d82aa9e20072082d7b1c6ac9542d49849ba8878e) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Bot usage can now report turns and tokens for a chosen period. The usage summary counts every turn since the requested time instead of stopping at the newest 200 ledger entries, so windows such as "this month" stay accurate for busy bots.

- [#182](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/182) [`e885d8b`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/e885d8b360d7c32cc98816a7b28d4a28b7220957) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A bot's status is now one of four states — asking, held, busy, idle — derived from the chats, work items and delegated children it already has: it is asking when an approval or question waits on you anywhere in its chat tree, held when it owns a blocked item or its turn waits on a child, busy when a turn is running, and idle otherwise. Archived chats no longer count, and a delegated sub-chat reports as its root bot.

- [#202](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/202) [`2383557`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/2383557f3fb2fa342dc91eb31c3f237be9cbb4c8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Squad setup hires a whole fleet in one step: `fleet.plan` previews the members and what still blocks them, and `fleet.hire` creates every bot and the group together under a single receipt, so a dropped connection can no longer leave a half-built squad.

- [#70](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/70) [`3b98dd3`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/3b98dd3663d53f7ce2ed0665340e1096ae12cb97) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Group chats on web, desktop and mobile now let you address bots: mention several, use `@everyone`, or reply to a bot's message on web and desktop. The chat shows who answers next with a Stop button, and a reply budget limits how long bots chain replies.

- [#73](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/73) [`b157946`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b1579463b04e8baae349d539393c5c40ec3dd156) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Group chats now let a bot hand the conversation to another member by mentioning it in a reply. Each chat has its own reply budget, from 1 to 20 and 6 by default, that caps how many replies a chain of mentions adds for one message. Bots you name yourself always answer, even past the budget, and a chain the budget cuts short is recorded so clients can say so.

- [#68](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/68) [`ff570fe`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ff570fe9d19abaf020b25d3f27bf02852fd55469) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Group chats can now address specific bots, a reply, or everyone in a message. The server runs the addressed bots one at a time, in order, and shows who is next. Stop ends the whole answer, including the bots still waiting, and a restart resumes a waiting queue.

- [#75](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/75) [`aff4aba`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/aff4abaf66a9022784475bafe876a6fd3b801397) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - On mobile you can now reply to one bot's message in a group chat: press and hold the message, choose Reply, and that bot answers.

- [#152](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/152) [`c1c6fcc`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/c1c6fcc39f5c40878a22517a633a089828e39931) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The phone can now open a bot's computer from the thread: watch the screen, take control, give it back, and return to a paused view after switching apps.

- [#92](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/92) [`0fa6098`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/0fa6098c078da18a5ff511bde66afdb633f99210) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Chat messages, the composer, and bot and chat names now take the direction of their own text, so Arabic, Hebrew, and other right-to-left text reads correctly in the English interface. Code, paths, and shortcut keys stay left to right.

- [#192](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/192) [`5064caf`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5064caf1d22b29cb07065b380e184e9b2c3af8bf) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A space's Overview now opens with its standup: what each bot is on right now and how many are asking, held, busy or idle, the cards waiting in the queue oldest first, and the blocked cards with who has to move first.

- [#187](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/187) [`c8b7257`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/c8b7257db8c3dca2a664d455e23ca857122b7b61) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A space's Tasks tab now has a board: five columns — New, In progress, Draft, Closed and Done — each card showing its owner and, when blocked, what it waits on. Add an item from the board or edit one, set its owner, close it as done or dropped, and reopen it, in light and dark themes and in English, Arabic and Simplified Chinese.

- [#183](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/183) [`289755e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/289755e5a98fc4ad83a2bdeec458995bdcdfafe8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A space now has a Tasks board. Add items, set an owner and a state, close an item as done or dropped, and reopen it, in light and dark themes.

- [#147](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/147) [`9a6e791`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/9a6e7910fb18da554477b81aa0dc33b8e449f887) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A space now opens with four tabs: Overview, Chat, Skills and Files, with the space name and tabs in one top bar. Overview shows the newest decision waiting on you, the space's active routines with the next run, this week's turns across its bots, and its recent chats with each chat's bot. Chat stays the default tab, so existing links are unchanged. The sidebar heading "Groups" is now "Spaces".

- [#194](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/194) [`5a33948`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5a339483f0e14669f787fdde06ae3b650a59bd2c) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Bots record the fleet role they were hired into, and a work item's role is now a fleet role id.

- [#105](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/105) [`2bfbaa9`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/2bfbaa9a6bdff0c055a9882c4c995bc33cbc1746) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A new Decisions group at the top of the bot list shows every chat where a bot is waiting on you for an approval or a question. Select a row to jump to that chat; it clears when you answer.

### Patch Changes

- [#211](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/211) [`e01783d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/e01783d6452eaeda2755df33f93c2ff7f831d673) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Arabic confirmation dialogs now split into a title and a body the way English and Chinese ones already did. The split looked for an ASCII or fullwidth question mark, and Arabic, Persian and Urdu ask with U+061F, so the whole sentence was landing in the dialog title with a generic line underneath.

- [#101](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/101) [`e82b1b6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/e82b1b6776bd3a187892b4ed6773244686d08eb5) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Arabic now mirrors the app layout: the sidebar, settings, chat and preview panels sit on the correct side, and back, next and expand arrows point the right way.

- [#216](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/216) [`f48562d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/f48562d10bd1907fcb22684d27f015d1e781a1de) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Deleting a bot that leads a space now says so in plain words before the delete, and a refused delete no longer shows the server's internal wording or raw ids.

- [#217](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/217) [`aa205af`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/aa205af50d194da5bda444bedafdadf43c27ac93) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A channel failure from a newer server no longer arrives as a parse error. The failure category
  crosses the wire as a plain string, so a build that predates a category still shows the server's
  message instead of losing it.

- [#104](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/104) [`b51a0b0`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b51a0b02762cfae3db343ad4c082ac8cab83353b) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The composer banner keeps its solid background in browsers without backdrop blur.

- [#193](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/193) [`7fbb68a`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/7fbb68a7a28d46d8150e08128aa6660ed248abb3) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A bot or group command now checks that the person issuing it may change that group, so someone outside a group can no longer rename bots, move them between groups, or reconfigure groups they do not belong to.

- [#122](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/122) [`f57671d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/f57671d9076de2cf41a0d313c970ec6d9c251453) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A bot can now hand work to a teammate, check on it, message it or stop it by the teammate's name, not only its ID. A name that matches two teammates is refused with both listed, and a name outside the current group is never revealed.

- [#204](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/204) [`dd09a4a`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/dd09a4a679b82d540121a025ad744fac86c62f15) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A keep-busy group now hands its next queued item to the bot that has been idle longest, instead of always to the first one by name. A bot that has never finished a turn goes first, and a tie falls back to the bot's id.

- [#200](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/200) [`2a8b7bc`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/2a8b7bcdd179e3a5c7dd9e8e2b6def688433ac63) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Keep-busy groups no longer hand work to a bot that is already occupied. A bot waiting on your answer, holding an approval, or with a turn already in flight counts as busy, so a group's queue waits for it instead of interrupting it.

- [#224](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/224) [`7ca1378`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/7ca13782281e44de95a2134711cd5c001f726254) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A keep-busy team no longer stops when the bot it picks has no chat yet. The dispatcher passes over
  that member, works the rest of the queue, and picks the group up again as soon as the chat exists.
  A lost claim no longer strands the items behind it, and one pass spends each bot once, so a bot in
  two groups is handed one item.

- [#150](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/150) [`1a82a0c`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/1a82a0cc619b1af2218156da6a21ca8ba22db03e) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The desktop's egress tunnel no longer buffers without limit: a destination that sends faster than the server reads is paused instead of filling desktop memory, and a lookup or connection that hangs is refused after ten seconds instead of holding the stream. When a profile leaves the desktop's egress binding, the tunnel reconnects from the store's current state.

- [#188](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/188) [`5b55c9b`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5b55c9b700f84a323b3ac0baa9d33f9dd00e9e2d) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Hiring a fleet now works out the squad before anything is created: the boss comes first, each member starts on the model picked for its role, and squad setup can say what still stops Create.

- [#198](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/198) [`a2a5b14`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/a2a5b144defd50f7d955ad7357ff9d0848ceb894) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Deleting a group is now an administrator action, and it refuses to take open work down with it unless the caller asks for that explicitly. A plain member could previously delete any group they belonged to, which discarded every work item the group held — finished ones included — and detached its chats. Two refusals replace that: a person without `access:write` is turned away, and a group that still holds open work items fails with an error naming the count until `discardWorkItems` is passed.

- [#205](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/205) [`79d2aac`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/79d2aac4ed144d4edbc233de6b5ff2cd7cb0fb10) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Deleting a group from the roster now tells you what the delete costs before it happens. When the group still holds open work items, the confirmation dialog names the count, its button reads "Delete and discard", and the app sends `discardWorkItems` only because you saw that number and confirmed it. A group with no open work keeps the plain "Delete group" dialog and never sends the flag. The two refusals the server can return — open work that was not confirmed for discard, and a person without `access:write` — now arrive as specific messages instead of the generic "Something went wrong" toast.

- [#123](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/123) [`ea5ea6d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ea5ea6dcae58a526affc08ecf5dde1000a2c1cb8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Importing a bot no longer brings along fallback models on standard OpenCode, which cannot be a fallback.

- [#174](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/174) [`23e6b61`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/23e6b613b1e94ea98aac2193ea86214fdd8a36c0) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A link-check run now reports what it found — how many links it checked, how many were broken, and the pages and links that broke — in one place the bot can read back.

- [#97](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/97) [`a7b233e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/a7b233ecac6c4efd4043209c4dfc2c7036731cba) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Relative times in the mobile chat list, archive, and image generation settings now follow the interface language instead of always showing English, and the usage and step meters format numbers, currency, percentages, and dates for it.

- [#208](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/208) [`5ea301d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5ea301dd84263e7b8ce5459f3c021388be2a3a9a) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Provider status no longer puts a full account email address on the wire. The signed-in account shows as a masked handle such as m\*\*\*@example.com, on every client and provider.

- [#170](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/170) [`0356f71`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/0356f71743d74b7f47ab6e5421c8899966544c52) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The server can project a thread for a member: their frames keep the conversation and the approval rows, and never carry the owner's commands, paths, tool output or approval arguments.

- [#160](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/160) [`f7bdd31`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/f7bdd31c8fc10a8664d00945e2319e31e5d75eb9) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Upgrading from a very old version no longer stores saved model options as a quoted string. The migration that converts legacy object-shaped options into the current array shape now writes a real array on SQLite 3.54 and newer, so older projects and chats keep loading their saved options correctly.

- [#221](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/221) [`42e85b0`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/42e85b0d9de7aa17f8c517b2ef4a4e494a1f898e) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - On mobile, a refused bot delete now explains itself in plain words instead of printing the server's internal sentence with raw ids.

- [#78](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/78) [`047fbe3`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/047fbe346c47e0a38c074e2f6c2610fc823bc5fd) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The iOS app prebuild works again: the widget logo now comes from the app icon instead of a deleted marketing file.

- [#220](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/220) [`fe42b24`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/fe42b2487cc0eee155f8edea792ae5eb1a19d4cc) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Moving a bot to another group now removes it from its old group. Before, the bot stayed on the first group's roster while its own record pointed at the new group, which could corrupt group deletion and dispatch, and the move skipped the boss and minimum-membership guards.

- [#227](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/227) [`64df7db`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/64df7db6d80077ac6fd0610024461c9b19c227ff) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A provider failure from a newer server no longer arrives as a parse error. The reason a provider
  could not run now crosses the wire as a plain string, in the dispatch error, in a chat's session and
  latest turn, and on a channel binding. A build that predates a reason still shows the server's own
  message instead of losing it.

- [#82](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/82) [`a49bd81`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/a49bd81444d426754a83aa2eeddbffc01dc746da) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Pressing Stop on an OpenCode bot right after sending a message now stops the turn instead of letting it run to the end.

- [#94](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/94) [`22029b7`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/22029b75b715240a9c45051f33e80c73ddc2006d) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The server log no longer shows a warning each time a group chat hand-off finds no new bot to start.

- [#225](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/225) [`0d5c90d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/0d5c90d490353eb5c5647727b03e6d2044d2fc0d) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Moving a bot to another group no longer strands the work it owned in the group it left. The items it had picked up there go back into that group's queue, unowned and ready for someone else, at the moment the bot leaves.

- [#145](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/145) [`d767f3a`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/d767f3a506b9f7f6795c391f1f1e054e32318b2c) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Interrupting a chat now closes any open question cards instead of leaving them waiting for an answer.

- [#207](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/207) [`ae9cc1b`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ae9cc1be5f8a674b713c4c6c5e1c97a417f79533) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A revoked provider sign-in now reads as a sign-in problem instead of an unknown failure. The chat names the provider and offers a control that opens its sign-in, Resume is no longer offered where only signing in again can fix it, and an expired sign-in is described as "expired or revoked" in every interface language.

- [#106](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/106) [`a171fe2`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/a171fe27689e05a25c076117c24ab9c45843a589) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A second server started on the same data directory now exits with a clear error naming the running server's pid and port, instead of running migrations against its database.

- [#213](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/213) [`919dcf6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/919dcf6de5e04fba132972daf2830ba7e8e3e87e) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A bot whose provider sign-in was revoked keeps showing the sign-in problem after a reload, instead of looking healthy until the next attempt fails. Signing in again clears it.

- [#215](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/215) [`009ec83`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/009ec8384de58b897380a051636339c50eace5c3) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Deleting a group that still holds open work, or one you lack permission to change, now shows the message the interface was built for. The server sends a refusal code with the failure instead of leaving the client to read its wording, so a future copyedit no longer quietly downgrades that toast to the raw sentence.

- [#223](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/223) [`f042de8`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/f042de88c8d3169d42cf170aedbece04e0cddbae) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Deleting one of two bots in a space is refused in plain words now, in every language, instead of showing the server's sentence with a group id in it.

- [#103](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/103) [`b1b650f`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b1b650f21525938d78f6fcb55ad7fd5a45fb88f8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Each paragraph of a message you send now reads in its own direction, so an Arabic paragraph followed by an English one no longer share a single direction.

- [#214](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/214) [`7df5510`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/7df551069e5eef7d6d05e2e291d9d409988bb877) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A voice transcript now takes its speaker from the chat instead of from the client. A transcript sent for a reply is attributed to the bot that chat is talking to, so a client can no longer name a bot the chat is not talking to.

- [#186](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/186) [`43f8dfe`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/43f8dfeafa6bd5ba75175630e247615160e45015) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - When the bot that owns a work item leaves its group, is archived, or is deleted, that item goes back in the queue for someone else to take.

- [#87](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/87) [`501761e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/501761e5b46ea75da27e17ed6d9b718312298ab8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A session revoked while its WebSocket was still connecting now closes that socket instead of staying open.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/38) [`8408d4a`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/8408d4a1ed8cfa2c491bddca6d3a3a762f732ba7) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Bots that pass a group member's name to CheckAgent or StopAgent now reach that member. An unknown target fails with a not-found error that lists the valid members.

- [#36](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/36) [`6eb303d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/6eb303d79e4d20a3c9eff0e0ccacb65cec57875a) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A revoked or expired session now closes its open WebSocket instead of leaving it working.

- [#39](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/39) [`ef9a1a6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/ef9a1a699e93dc68d552459b4ef1f98d623922cf) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The desktop app now serves its privileged IPC channels only to its own window, so a preview page can no longer call them.

- [#28](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/28) [`fe433f7`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/fe433f7c78720c3925eb2c5e8d7654feb34c572f) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The dev runner no longer lets an inherited `ISNADI_HOME` or `AKERU_HOME` override the worktree home or `--home-dir`.

- [#44](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/44) [`e6638a2`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/e6638a282c9f87defad44173f690e0d8c4f5e1e8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A group's details now list the paired people who are not in the group, so someone who was removed can be added back. Removing a person, or leaving a group yourself, asks for confirmation first.

- [#60](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/60) [`b0d7b74`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b0d7b74f6640a7f1734c0796c97630c0a315e619) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - In a group chat, each bot now knows who said what: other members' messages reach a bot as quoted group messages instead of its own words, and every bot is told who is in the group each turn.

- [#26](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/26) [`976df55`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/976df55874bc87a12c9afd13ae19de43e5a95be5) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Remote clients no longer show "Open logs folder", "Open keybindings.json", or the invalid-keybindings toast action. They used to open the editor on the server machine and report success, so from a phone or a laptop over Tailscale nothing visible happened.

- [#40](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/40) [`8249aa2`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/8249aa2a925d43a87ee6d11d9d837cc3c4731352) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Isnadi no longer reads `T3CODE_HOME`, which belongs to T3 Code, as its data directory. With only `T3CODE_HOME` set, the server, desktop app and dev runner now use `~/.isnadi` (or the worktree's `.isnadi`) and log one warning that names `ISNADI_HOME`. Set `ISNADI_HOME` to use another folder.

- [#42](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/42) [`e57facd`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/e57facdafe5eb8ed6c400b3e128bd25d4436ab01) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The Remote installers (scripts and the copies served from the web app) now move an existing `~/.akeru` into `~/.isnadi` before creating it, so chats, pairing and the environment ID carry over.

- [#52](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/52) [`9a8c6b4`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/9a8c6b4805b0c638cdad082dbc1e53be4aea40a5) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Isnadi now names its browser session cookie `isnadi_session` instead of `t3_session`. Sessions created before the update keep working: the old cookie is still accepted and replaced with the new one the next time the page checks the session.

- [#41](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/41) [`0c47634`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/0c476345197153effa7146fa80aa2f075ee431df) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Opening IsnadiBot in a browser on the same address as T3 Code (both use port 3773) no longer deletes T3 Code's saved connections, and Isnadi no longer imports them. Isnadi never opens, copies or removes T3 Code's browser data.

- [#47](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/47) [`23961c6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/23961c6926155ca8b88d01a0ba7e3eb1884d9ebb) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - In group chats, a reply now shows the name and avatar of the bot that wrote it as it arrives, instead of the boss bot until you reload.

  Threads that web and mobile had already cached are dropped once, so group replies loaded from the cache after an update also show the right bot.

- [#25](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/25) [`59d307d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/59d307db07d7870b9dcb9c23c5869eeb5a357276) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - IsnadiBot no longer ships a built-in analytics key, so a build from source sends no usage analytics unless one is configured.

- [#32](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/32) [`5390f5e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5390f5ea2910e6de6904193e03f23f04b300f5e5) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A read-only pairing link now works from the desktop and mobile apps. They ask for read and operate access, and the link used to be consumed and then rejected. The connection now pairs with read-only access.

- [#37](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/37) [`23ca29b`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/23ca29b25c0ed468609fdfeca07afddbb9e61aa8) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The Windows Isnadi Remote installer now checks the release manifest's signature against IsnadiBot's pinned key and refuses to install an archive the signed manifest does not list.

- [#33](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/33) [`4ae33b0`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/4ae33b08a34545bb705733caab234ad2f5837550) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - SSH hosts whose alias, hostname or username starts with "-" or contains whitespace or control characters are now rejected, and SSH connections end their options with "--" so a host name can never be read as an ssh option.

- [#48](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/48) [`de147c3`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/de147c359a47ce6492234e82f1749aedb27ca1cf) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - A routine's skill picker now offers only the skills the bot's engine has enabled. A skill the engine no longer provides is not offered.

## 0.0.1

First IsnadiBot release.

### Minor Changes

- [`57c1afb`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/57c1afb08cdf9c019591aaa1eefe07a286dc2fb1) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Archived bots no longer appear in the sidebar. They are listed in Settings > Archived, where you can restore or delete them, and Isnadi deletes them automatically 7 days after they were archived. Their chats stay in your history.

- [`55028ce`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/55028ceeba4e029856722f957a07fb8f5b1fe9a6) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add backup accounts to a provider, named by plan, and bots move to the next one when an account hits a usage limit. New bots start on Claude Opus 5.5 for Claude, Grok 4.7 for Grok, and GPT-6 Luna for OpenCode Go. The model picker moved from the chat composer into the bot's settings, chats show a sign-in card when a bot's provider needs connecting, and the macOS desktop sidebar no longer crowds the window controls.

- [`51d4a5b`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/51d4a5b481a51b4576233fdfe98643104807414c) Thanks [@robzlabz](https://github.com/robzlabz)! - Add a Custom API provider that runs bots on any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. When you add one, pick OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Fireworks, LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, or Other; a preset fills in the base URL and name. Paste a key into the API key field, which stores it as a secret. The model list comes from `{baseUrl}/models`, and model names you add by hand are kept. Several instances can run side by side, such as a local server and a hosted gateway.

- [#13](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/13) [`daaa280`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/daaa2800ec88c79b659d2a78cec81dc84a3f154e) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The product is now IsnadiBot everywhere: the `isnadi` command, `ISNADI_*` environment variables, `~/.isnadi`, and the `isnadi://` desktop scheme. Existing data moves over on first launch, including the server database, the app's stored settings and themes, saved connections, in-app browser sessions, and old chat blocks and archives. The old `AKERU_*` environment variables still work. Product feedback is off until you set your own endpoint.

- [`4c23d3e`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/4c23d3ead61924a979aafcde6c069667284ce0fa) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add a second account from a provider's page with **Add account**. The dialog no longer asks which provider to use or lists providers Isnadi does not support. Adding a ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Kimi, or OpenCode Go account only asks for a name; sign in from the new account's card.

- [`020a7b5`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/020a7b5c9630fa7a2a603771cca25128b3cacc15) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bot questions now appear as a card with one question at a time, round marks for single-choice and checkboxes for multi-select, number-key shortcuts, and an in-card field for your own answer. Answers show as a summary instead of a plain text message. Replies can render charts, stats, task lists, timelines, flow diagrams, and choices in your theme's colors. The Isnadi Paper and Isnadi Noir themes no longer use purple, and the question card no longer links to the bot's computer.

### Patch Changes

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Cancelling a new chat request no longer leaves an empty chat behind or deletes a chat whose first message was already accepted.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Fix server startup under Node when the Bun global is absent.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Cancelling a message with an uploaded file no longer deletes the file when the message was still sent.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Validate remote browser connection details before opening a browser.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Read image attachments without blocking the server or loading oversized files.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Report database migration failures instead of accepting incomplete thread summaries.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Respect safe integer settings when reading SQLite query values.

- [`9677596`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/967759677e942b181b58792234d87cd6d0512adc) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Model lists for ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Kimi For Coding, and OpenCode Go now come from models.dev and refresh on their own, so new models appear without an app update. The picker shows readable names such as "GPT-6.1 Sol", lists GPT-6.1 Sol, Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Sonnet 5.5, and Claude Fable 5.1, and moves older models to the legacy section.

- [#11](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/11) [`5ea8903`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/5ea89035410a6c06c66e67fb8b97f476eb7c1fb9) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - The packaged desktop app loads again instead of showing "This view failed to load".

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Stopping the server no longer waits forever on chat requests still queued behind a stalled command.

- [#1](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/1) [`dfe1d42`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/dfe1d42c0e4556a5e056d303399db1cf9110269f) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Group chats now run bots without their own model on a connected provider, the same as a 1:1 chat, instead of reporting "No provider is ready for this group".

- [#2](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/2) [`9befebd`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/9befebdb2931288f6304f777586f801a33dcb4b0) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Sending in a group no longer fails with "Person … is not a member of group …" after the desktop app restarts. The app's owner can always send in their own groups.

- [#23](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/23) [`1a0e45a`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/1a0e45aebcbad8059a3e37f5d1dab0cd3efdf4f3) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - In group chats, the bot you @mention now answers as itself instead of the boss bot.

- [`b2ba9a8`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b2ba9a88add2d4024c0accd57f4d7151f03e3c84) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Fix model-specific reasoning controls and runtime forwarding across all providers, with saved bot choices shared by web, desktop, and mobile.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Recognize existing thread summary columns regardless of their SQLite identifier casing.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Keep deeply nested tool payloads within projection limits and preserve dispatch defects and interruptions.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Keep pending requests and queued starts blocking chat settlement after a server restart, and allow reactions on older chat messages.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Keep Unicode characters intact when shortening long tool activity details.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Correct shared-client classification of background policy subscriptions so they reconnect as streams rather than being treated as unary requests.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Require approval for tool inputs that exceed the action inspection budget instead of crashing on large arrays.

- [`b2ba9a8`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b2ba9a88add2d4024c0accd57f4d7151f03e3c84) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Remove the per-bot token hard stop. Bots no longer refuse new messages after a set token count, and bot settings and usage on web, desktop, and mobile no longer show a cap.

- [#24](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/pull/24) [`56477bc`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/56477bcdb6301d2bfac4517d4de029762f90fd67) Thanks [@mohammadchehab](https://github.com/mohammadchehab)! - Isnadi Remote now verifies release manifests against IsnadiBot's own signing key instead of upstream's.

- [`b480523`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/b480523bf6f988aeea4643df6b1e749d324643cd) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Update Electron and other dependencies to releases that fix known security vulnerabilities.

- [`a280aa6`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/a280aa6c8fea87f84b067152f9aaf66487112fea) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - A bot chat now says when its provider isn't signed in, using the account's name and logo (for example "Claude is not connected"), and its Connect button opens that provider's settings page. Before, the chat showed "Provider instance 'claudeAgent' is not available." and asked you to send feedback.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Finish failed temporary workers when startup errors have an empty message, so waiting chats receive a result and the worker slot is released.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Refresh saved connection health and pending logins when reading or refreshing subscription credentials.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Mobile: snoozed chats on Home now refresh their wake time label with the minute clock, matching the iPad sidebar.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Mobile: the new chat environment picker no longer calls a React hook while its module loads.

- [`66ba44d`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/66ba44dfcde1fbb3e63cf27f2afb73001baa26c5) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Keep missing mobile theme colors from crashing rendering and retain valid saved connections when another stored row is incomplete.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- upstream #341 [`3b141ca`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/3b141ca6b2f68b982e870e6b57ce1e5a886caa23) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok sign-ins no longer require their CLIs to be installed. Chat titles and branch names use the saved Isnadi connection too.

  Existing Codex, Claude, and Grok model selections remain usable, connection status updates immediately after sign-in or sign-out, and generated titles and branch names retain model options and screenshot context. Writing requests have a three-minute deadline and continue with text when a screenshot is unavailable.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - The server now reads `ISNADI_*` environment variables, with the `T3CODE_*` names kept as fallbacks. The background service is now `isnadibot.service` (systemd) or `dev.leodoes.isnadi.service` (launchd); installing it retires an older Isnadi-installed `t3code.service` unit. Provider requests now identify the app as IsnadiBot.

- upstream #335 [`779d43c`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/779d43c5d8ff55e7ee24df04b471915aed97868a) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Delete a bot from its settings page on web, or from chat settings on mobile. Deleting removes the bot from the roster, detaches its chats, stops its work, channels, and voice call, cancels work it sent or received, and removes its routines and skill assignments. Group chats keep their group and fall back to the boss when the deleted bot was answering. A group boss cannot be deleted until another bot takes over, and a bot cannot be deleted when its removal would leave a group with fewer than two active bots.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bot and group chats now offer the `$` skill and `/` command menus. The Errors settings page is now called Bot inbox, the Image generation breadcrumb uses sentence case, a disconnected image provider shows a single status line, and a new bot's routine panel explains that its chat must start before a routine can be added.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Watch a bot's Daytona computer live, take control to click and type for it, return control, or stop it. Open it from the bot panel or when a bot asks you a question. The mobile app shows when a bot's computer is running and points to desktop or web.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - The bot side panel on web and desktop lists the bot's recent chats. Select one to open an older chat in place of the newest, or start a new chat from the same list. The roster still shows one row per bot.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bots can create and edit images with your connected ChatGPT or Grok subscription, whatever model they chat with. Images are saved in the chat, count toward the bot's usage, and can be opened, saved, copied, or shown in the file manager. Isnadi asks before sending your images to a fallback provider.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Codex and Kimi For Coding bots can now create images with your enabled image providers, save guidance for an MCP server, and read public web pages safely. Page reads stay pinned to a checked public address and stop at 2 MB. Web search reports that it isn't available yet instead of making up results.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Show when a bot channel is connecting, mark it for reconnect as soon as a Discord or iMessage connection drops, and replace messaging-service error text with fixed Isnadi messages so tokens never reach clients or logs. Channel replies now come only from the connected bot, and messages written by other bots no longer start turns.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Channel replies now show where they came from and whether they were delivered. Web and mobile thread views render the external origin on inbound channel messages and a per-reply delivery state (sending, sent, failed, or unknown) on the bot's answer. When the environment advertises a public origin (`--public-origin` or `T3CODE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`), external replies end with an "Open in Isnadi" link to the bot.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Work cards in bot and group chats now sit right after the exchange that started the work and keep that place across reloads. Each card shows elapsed time, tokens, and **Scheduled** or **Retried** labels. The access grant moves behind **Details**, **View work** opens a read-only view of the other bot's chat, and group cards name the bot that asked.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bot work that failed or was canceled can be retried once as new work, and a bot can keep work running after the reply that started it stops. Work cards on mobile now offer Let it finish, Cancel, and Try again too. A routine can now hand each run to another bot: pick it under **Done by** in the routine form, and the run settles with that bot's work. Bots that cannot take handed-off work show as unavailable in that list.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add a scoped durable-facts read RPC for memory views.

- upstream #303 [`c7dbad4`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/c7dbad44a97685562976f184e3601eafeede37c0) Thanks [@usehoplite](https://github.com/apps/usehoplite)! - Add Railway bot workspaces with durable identity reattachment and saved credentials. Railway VMs remain running while idle; previews require a CLI tunnel and automatic bot browser routing is unavailable.

  Deleting a bot leaves its Railway VM running; the Railway guide explains how to retire it.

  Preserve sandbox inheritance when editing bot settings. Keep same-chat turns in order while preparing attachments without blocking other chats.

  Interrupting a chat also cancels turns waiting for attachment preparation, while allowing new turns after the interrupt.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bots in a group chat can hand work only to bots in that group. The bot that did the work posts its result in the group when it finishes, unless it left the group while working.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Redesign the bot sidebar, creation dialog, and settings, with per-bot panel state, faster General loading, clearer provider accounts, and separate Sandbox and Browser pages.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add image generation provider settings: ChatGPT and Grok rows backed by the existing subscription credentials, a global enable/default/fallback-order settings block, a real health test, and a nullable per-bot image-provider selection.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add an interface language setting with English and Simplified Chinese. Each browser, desktop installation, and mobile device keeps its own choice, follows the device language by default, and can reset to the system default. Settings search and the command palette find the setting in either language. Connection errors are explained in the selected language while the original diagnostic stays available.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Mobile chats now show delegated work as cards inside the conversation. Each card sits right after the message that started the work, keeps its place across reloads, and collapses with that turn's work log, matching the web chat timeline.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Connect separate subscription accounts to provider instances without replacing the default account.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add scoped durable memory archives with checksummed history and explicit per-record conflict resolutions.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Durable memory facts can now be edited, pinned, moved between private, bot, and project scope, approved or rejected, forgotten, and deleted from web, desktop, and mobile. A new Memory section in settings turns memory on or off, controls private bot memory, and chooses whether facts shared with a project wait for approval.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Mobile can now review one bot's usage. Settings > General > Usage lists the bots in each connected environment, and opening a bot shows its input, output, Observer, and Reflector tokens, its cap, an estimated cost, subscription pool use, and reserved tokens. Measurements a provider did not report read Unavailable instead of zero, partly reported measurements read as a floor, and the estimated cost is labelled as a model-rate estimate rather than subscription spend. The cap is read-only on mobile. The screen points to chat settings, where it can be changed.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Manage a bot's routines from mobile chat settings, see a proposed routine's schedule and instructions before approving it, and clear every bot inbox item from mobile.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bots no longer wait for work they send to other bots. The bot replies first, the work card updates when the other bot finishes, and the result reaches your bot once, in its next reply.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - The command palette on web and desktop searches your chats again. Typing lists chats whose title or messages match under Chats, and selecting one opens it in its bot's view.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Show contextual bot activity with an expandable history of real tool actions, clearer reply references, and larger reactions. Give routine, command, and question prompts the same quiet review surface, with distinct schedule and task text for routines and neutral command text. Fix shell approvals when the model includes an empty working directory, and keep the server responsive while interrupted bot work recovers after a restart.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add the self-hosted Isnadi Remote installer, signed release archives for Linux x64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64, diagnostics commands, a Docker deployment with an image health check, and administration helpers that keep state in `ISNADI_HOME` or `~/.isnadi`.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Remote pairing is easier on a headless machine. `isnadi pair` prints a QR code on a terminal (turn it off with `--no-qr`), accepts `--public-url` for a tunnel you manage, and `isnadi pair --admin` creates the first admin link until an admin device is paired. A new remote install prints one admin pairing link on first boot, which `isnadi remote logs` now shows. Admins can see remote health, re-run the checks, and repair individual checks from Settings > Connections. The doctor now reports a fresh home as "not created yet" instead of raw file errors, and says that Kimi For Coding and OpenCode Go need no command on the machine.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Remove the remaining coding-agent features inherited from T3 Code. The user terminal, the mobile files, Git, and Add Project screens, the GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket integrations, the `t3.json` project file, project icons, the local/worktree choice for new chats, and plan mode are gone. New chats start in the project checkout, and worktree branch names use the default text generation model. Chats and settings saved by older versions still load: plan-mode chats continue in default mode, and old pairing links and tokens that carry the terminal scope keep working without it.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Remove the code review and pull request features inherited from T3 Code. Chats no longer offer diff review, review comments, pull request linking, or commit, push, and pull request actions. New pairing links no longer grant the review scope, and older sessions and tokens that carry it keep working.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bots can ask to save a fact to shared project, group, or workspace memory. You approve, edit, or reject it from a card in the chat or from the bot inbox on desktop, web, and mobile. Sensitive facts always wait for approval.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Bots can hand a bounded part of a request to up to three temporary helpers, check on them, send them follow-ups, and stop them. Helpers stop when the request ends and don't appear as separate chats.

- upstream #304 [`017f6e0`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/017f6e0c6835d87666e63dd37eebb04ed8d6ad45) Thanks [@usehoplite](https://github.com/apps/usehoplite)! - Add Tenki sandboxes with persistent Linux VMs and snapshot-backed pause and resume. Connect a Tenki API key in Sandbox settings to use it for bots. Sandbox browser control is unavailable because Tenki previews are public.

  Preserve persistent workspaces after connector failures and retry idle pauses after readiness failures without racing active acquisitions.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Translate the web bot roster, chats, composer, bot settings, new bot and group dialogs, onboarding, and error view into Simplified Chinese. On mobile, archived chats, the empty workspace screen, swipe actions, and alerts are now translated too.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - When a bot's model cannot run, Isnadi now keeps the model, marks it unavailable, and turns Send off with the reason and one next step instead of sending a message that never gets a reply. The model list shows signed-out and turned-off providers dimmed with the reason, and connecting a provider unlocks its models without a restart. The same check covers bot settings, new-bot setup, voice calls, and mobile.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Voice calls can use your own OpenAI API, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, or Fish Audio key. Connect, test, replace, and disconnect keys in Settings > Voice. The new "Transcribe, reply, speak" mode sends what you say to the bot as a chat message and speaks its reply. Provider errors now say whether the key, quota, or network failed.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Add authenticated voice provider connections with transcription and stored-reply synthesis for supported clients.

- upstream #302 [`14b56b3`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/14b56b3d9ab03ab6ccb1cbfcc41f12a87b538f47) Thanks [@usehoplite](https://github.com/apps/usehoplite)! - Add Ascii Box sandbox support with persistent VMs, saved workspace reattachment, native snapshot-backed stop and resume, and protected browser access. Configure its API key in Sandbox settings.

- upstream #293 [`1c1dada`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/1c1dadaa2ec4d7c9b8f76d6807a67094176a66c8) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Replace saved facts with editable, bot-owned memory notes that follow bots across chats. Keep separate notes for each group, review durable preferences periodically, and keep up to 30 complete recent turns within a roughly 64,000-token budget alongside conversation observations.

### Patch Changes

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Retrying a message the server already accepted no longer reports a failure when its provider has since become unavailable.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Preserve legacy connection and mobile settings data while migrating storage keys, including asynchronous web storage and failed cleanup attempts.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Usage analytics queued with Cursor counters before an upgrade now deliver instead of blocking every later report.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - When a bot's provider fails while you answer its question, the chat now shows the provider's error instead of claiming the session restarted.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - When an answer to a bot's question fails to send, the question stays open to answer again instead of the chat reporting a restarted session.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - A failed answer to a bot's question now keeps the question open only when the bot can still take the answer. Otherwise the chat closes the question and asks you to send the request again.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Cancelling an API key sign-in while it is being saved no longer stores the key.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Restoring a memory archive while Private bot memory is off now restores the other notes and only refuses a changed MEMORY.md.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - An archived bot no longer picks up an interrupted request when you tap Resume, and voice you speak in its chat is no longer saved. This applies to direct chats and group chats.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - Archived bots no longer answer messages or voice sent from another device or a queued request. The chat explains that the bot is archived and how to restore it.

- upstream #322 [`630de12`](https://github.com/mohammadchehab/isnadibot/commit/630de12aeb4fe350ec957af323566a31aa85ebad) Thanks [@leoisadev1](https://github.com/leoisadev1)! - On Windows, `isnadi remote uninstall` removes the Isnadi Remote task, `isnadi remote rollback` restarts it, and reinstalling always rebuilds the runtime from the verified archive.
