## Concepts

### Project and workspace

#### Project

The workspace record behind a bot's chats. Users do not manage projects directly: they are an internal workspace detail of each bot, and clients no longer show project icons or read a project file. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a project has a `workspaceRoot` and a title. It does not contain threads: `OrchestrationProject` and `OrchestrationThread` are separate arrays on the read model, and a project can have zero threads. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Workspace root

The root filesystem path for a project. In [the orchestration model][1], it is the project checkout where new threads run, and the base directory for optional worktrees. See [workspace-layout.md][2].

#### Worktree

A Git worktree used as an isolated workspace for a thread. If a thread has a `worktreePath` in [the contracts][1], it runs there instead of in the main working tree. Clients no longer offer the local/worktree choice or the `defaultThreadEnvMode` setting, so new threads start in the project checkout. The server still honors a thread that was created with a worktree, and names its branch with the default text generation model (`textGenerationModelSelection`). Git operations live behind the VCS driver contract in `apps/server/src/vcs/VcsDriver.ts`, implemented by [GitVcsDriverCore.ts][3].

### Thread timeline

#### Thread

The internal durable record for one user-facing chat and its workspace history. In [the orchestration contracts][1], a thread holds messages, activities, checkpoints, and session-related state. Interface copy and user documentation call this a chat or conversation. See [projector.ts][4].

#### Turn

A single user-to-assistant work cycle inside a thread. It starts with user input and ends when the session leaves `running` status, which [projector.ts][4] treats as the authoritative completion signal (`settledTurnStateForSessionStatus`). Checkpoint and diff work may settle afterward without changing when the turn ended. See [the contracts][1] and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Silent run

A running turn whose provider has sent no output for `SILENCE_WATCHDOG_SILENT_MS` (90 seconds). Ingestion records it as a `turn.silent` activity and clears it with `turn.silent.cleared` or the end of the turn. It is a status, not a failure: nothing interrupts the turn. See [silence-watchdog.md](./silence-watchdog.md).

#### Temporary worker

A short-lived helper a bot starts with the Task tool during its own turn. It runs in a hidden child thread under a narrower grant, cannot start workers of its own, and is canceled when the parent turn ends. It is not a bot and is separate from bot-to-bot delegation. See [providers.md](./providers.md#temporary-workers).

### Roster organization

The live sidebar is `BotRosterSidebar`. Pins and the main Bots list are a client layout over bots and groups. They must not assign or remove group members, and they must not settle chats. Drag planning lives in `roster.logic.ts`; pointer cleanup, insertion-gap projection, and list motion live beside it in `roster.pointer.ts`, `roster.drag.ts`, and `roster.motion.ts`.

#### Decisions

The top group of the web roster sidebar: live chats in the primary environment where a bot waits on the user. `selectDecisions` in `packages/client-runtime/src/decisions.ts` derives it from `hasPendingApprovals` and `hasPendingUserInput` on thread shells, and a delegated sub-chat stands for its root chat: the row shows the root's title, while `targetThreadId` names the chat that holds the prompt (the newest pending approval in the tree, otherwise the newest question) and is what the row opens. Rows order by `updatedAt`, which a streaming pending chat keeps bumping, so two pending rows can swap places mid-stream. `environmentDecisionsAtom` emits only when the rows change, so streaming progress does not re-render the sidebar. `DecisionsGroup` renders it and `useOpenChat` jumps to a row.

#### Activity

A user-visible log item attached to a thread. In [the contracts][1], activities cover important non-message events like approvals, tool actions, and failures. They are projected into thread state in [projector.ts][4].

#### Bot memory

Small, server-owned Markdown context attached to one named bot: `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and one
bot-specific `GROUP.md` per group. It is distinct from bot instructions and thread observational
memory. See [memory architecture](memory.md).

#### Memory approval

A pending request from a bot to save a shared durable fact at project, group, or workspace scope.
It appears as a chat card and a bot inbox item, and either one decides it through
`candidate.decide`. See [shared memory approvals](memory.md#shared-memory-approvals).

#### Observational memory

An automatically generated, inspectable summary of older content in one thread. It complements the
recent complete-turn window and never acts as a writable group-wide memory store. See
[memory architecture](memory.md).

### Role and fleet template

A **role** is a built-in teammate definition in `packages/contracts/src/fleet/roles.ts`: name, job, avatar, driver kind and model, reasoning level, skills. A **fleet template** is a named set of roles with one boss, used to seed a squad. See [fleet-operations.md](./fleet-operations.md#role-library).

### Orchestration

Orchestration is the server-side domain layer that turns runtime activity into stable app state. The main entry point is [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7], with core logic in [decider.ts][8] and [projector.ts][4].

#### Aggregate

The domain object a command or event belongs to. In [the contracts][1], that is usually `project` or `thread`. See [decider.ts][8].

#### Command

A typed request to change domain state. In [the contracts][1], commands are validated in [commandInvariants.ts][9] and turned into events by [decider.ts][8].
Examples include `thread.create`, `thread.turn.start`, and `thread.checkpoint.revert`.

#### Domain Event

A persisted fact that something already happened. In [the contracts][1], events are the source of truth, and [projector.ts][4] shows how they are applied.
Examples include `thread.created`, `thread.message-sent`, and `thread.turn-diff-completed`.

#### Decider

The pure orchestration logic that turns commands plus current state into events. The core implementation is in [decider.ts][8], with preconditions in [commandInvariants.ts][9].

#### Projection

A read-optimized view derived from events. See [projector.ts][4], [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11], and [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10].

#### Projector

The logic that applies domain events to the read model or projection tables. See [projector.ts][4] and [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11].

#### Read model

The current materialized view of orchestration state. In [the contracts][1], it holds projects, threads, messages, activities, checkpoints, and session state. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10] and [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7].

#### Reactor

A side-effecting service that handles follow-up work after events or runtime signals. Examples include [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], [ProviderCommandReactor.ts][12], and [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Receipt

A typed signal emitted when an async milestone completes, such as `checkpoint.baseline.captured`, `checkpoint.diff.finalized`, or `turn.processing.quiesced`. Receipts are a test-only mechanism: the production `RuntimeReceiptBusLive` publish is a no-op and only the test layer is PubSub-backed. Do not build production behavior on them. See [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13] and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Quiesced

"Quiesced" means a turn has gone quiet and stable: follow-up work such as [CheckpointReactor.ts][6] has settled. It appears in [the receipt schema][13], so in practice it is something tests wait on rather than a production signal.

#### Delegation

Work one bot sends to another with `SendToAgent`. It runs in a child thread and returns a handle at once. Its finished result is acknowledged exactly once, when the parent's next turn starts or when `CheckAgent` reads it. See [delegation.md](delegation.md).

#### Waiting on children

A thread with queued, running, or blocked delegations. Derived by `isThreadWaitingOnChildren`, never persisted.

### Channels

External channels connect a messaging conversation (Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, or WhatsApp) to normal Isnadi orchestration. See [channels.md](./channels.md) and the [user guide](../user/channels.md).

#### Channel connection profile

A reusable record for one set of provider credentials, holding only safe display data such as the provider, a name, the external identity, and optional `managementUrl` and `webhookUrl`. Credentials live in the environment secret store, never on the profile. A profile can be saved unassigned and attached later.

#### Channel binding

The assignment of a channel connection profile to a bot and a project, carried on the bot record. It reports health through `status`, `lastError`, `failureCategory`, and `lastSucceededAt`. Statuses are `connecting`, `connected`, `needs-reconnect`, `failed`, `blocked` (project unavailable), `not-live` (WhatsApp without a public origin), and `disconnected`. See the health section of [channels.md](./channels.md).

#### Channel origin

The provenance record on a thread or message that came from an external channel: provider, connection, external conversation and message identities, and sender display name. It drives thread subscriptions restored on startup and the origin label clients render.

#### Channel delivery

The per-reply delivery state (`pending`, `sent`, `failed`, `unknown`) mirrored from the durable delivery store onto each channel-originated assistant message. `unknown` means provider acceptance could not be proven; Isnadi never reposts it automatically.

### Egress

#### Egress grant

A host (exact, or a wildcard that also covers the apex) that a profile may reach through the desktop's egress provider. Grants are stored by [the desktop grant store](./egress.md#egress-grants), checked against the desktop's own profile binding, and never loosen the address checks.

### Dictation

Hold-to-talk capture on the active client that transcribes into the current composer draft. The
session, identity binding, and draft merging live in `packages/client-runtime/src/dictation`, which
also binds transcription to the environment's `voice.transcribe` RPC. Browser capture lives in
`apps/web/src/lib/dictationCapture.ts` and native capture in
`apps/mobile/src/lib/expoDictationCapture.ts`. A transcript is applied only while the environment,
thread, draft, and draft generation still match the ones captured at start.

### Computer viewer

The client window that shows a bot's Daytona computer and hands input control between the bot and one
person. The state machine and the controller that serializes RPC calls live in
`packages/client-runtime/src/state/computerViewer.ts` and `computerViewerController.ts`. The web
client renders it; mobile only points to desktop or web. See
[computer-control.md](./computer-control.md#client-lifecycle).

### Stored-reply playback

Reading an existing assistant message on the current client speaker. Identity, spoken-text conversion, playback ownership, and the client-local automatic-readout preference live in `packages/client-runtime/src/replyPlayback`. Synthesis credentials and the speech operation belong to the live-call voice work, not this module. See [reply-playback.md](./reply-playback.md).

### Subscription provider

A consumer AI account that a user connects through OAuth, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Kimi For Coding. OpenCode Go uses an API key instead of OAuth. The environment server stores the credential and gives a run only the access token it needs. See [subscription authentication](./subscription-auth.md).

### Image provider

The subscription that creates images for a bot, ChatGPT or Grok, chosen per bot or by the global default and independent of the bot's chat provider. Bots reach it through the `generate_image` tool, and each finished image is saved as an ordinary chat attachment. See [image-generation.md](./image-generation.md).

### Interface language

A client-local preference for interface copy. Web, Electron, and native mobile each store their own selection. It never rewrites stored messages, bot names, instructions, paths, or protocol identifiers. See [interface-translations.md](./interface-translations.md) and [app language](../user/language.md).

### LTR island

An element pinned to left-to-right whatever the interface direction: code, diffs, the terminal, paths, URLs, model ids, and shortcut chords. In an Arabic interface the layout mirrors around them, but their content is never reordered. See [interface-translations.md](./interface-translations.md#right-to-left-languages).

### Browser sign-in

#### Sign-in request

The durable record of one bot asking for a site, in one thread. Its state is `asking`, `in_progress`,
`signed_in`, `failed`, `dismissed` or `expired`; there is no `cancelled`, because Cancel returns a bot's
request to `asking` and Not now is the only decline. The decider owns the state, the first terminal event
wins, and the card the owner sees is a view of it. See [site sign-in](./site-signin.md#states).

#### Sign-in flow

One attempt to sign the owner in, started by Sign in on a request and bounded by a profile lease. Its
phases are discovering, awaiting input, external action, human, submitting and completed. A second client's
Sign in joins the running flow instead of starting another, and a flow is never cut by request expiry.

#### Profile

The encrypted session IsnadiBot keeps for one site: one row per site, with the storage state sealed under a
per-profile key derived from the vault master key. A profile is not permission for a bot to use the site;
that is a session grant. See [credential vault](./credential-vault.md).

#### Profile generation

A monotonic integer on the profile row. Every write names the generation it started from and is refused if
that is no longer current, which is what stops a late save or a health check from resurrecting a profile the
owner signed out of. The similar-sounding lease protects exclusive use, not writes.

#### Tombstone

What sign-out leaves behind: the profile row at `generation + 1` with the ciphertext, grants, handles and
saved password removed. It keeps the site in the shell for 24 hours so Check and Sign in again can say "this
site is signed out", and a fresh sign-in starts from its generation.

#### Session grant

The owner's permission for one bot, in one thread, to use one signed-in profile. It ends at sign-out,
profile delete, removal of the bot from the thread or group, bot delete, or 30 days unused. An opaque handle
is what the bot actually holds, and it is revoked on turn end.

#### Auth host

A host, other than the site's own domain, that a sign-in passed through, such as an SSO provider. The owner
approves each one at save, its cookies are kept and every other third-party cookie is dropped, and an auth
host never creates an [egress grant](#egress-grant).

#### Auth-check URL

The single https URL the owner fixed at sign-in that a health check may fetch to decide whether the session
is still good. Nothing else, and no bot, can set or change it.

### Fleet operations

How a group of bots with a boss keeps working without someone driving it. See
[fleet operations](./fleet-operations.md).

#### Work item

One piece of work in a group, with an owner bot, a state (queued through done, or closed) and an optional
tracker link. The dispatcher assigns queued items to idle bots. Only open items reach the shell; finished ones
are paged on demand.

#### Dispatcher

The server reactor that assigns the next queued work item when a bot goes idle, and wakes the boss only when a
choice needs judgement. It runs only in groups with Keep busy on.

#### Handoff

A bot's state doc (item, branch, what is done, the next step, what it waits on, what not to do), written
before its context resets. The next turn starts from it.

#### Context epoch

A counter on a thread. Turns before the current epoch, and the thread's observations, no longer reach the
model; the visible transcript stays.

### Skills

A skill is a folder holding a `SKILL.md` and its files, which a bot loads when a task needs it. See
[the skills registry](./skills-registry.md).

#### Skill registry

The server-owned list of every skill in one environment: built in, space, yours (all spaces), Community and
provider. Clients read it with `skills.list`, so local, remote and mobile clients see the same list.

#### Skill index

The short list of skill names and one-line descriptions joined into a Mastra bot's instructions. The bot calls
`load_skill` or `read_skill_file` to read a skill in full, and each load shows in the chat.

#### Community skill

A skill added from a GitHub URL or a .zip. It reaches no bot until the user approves it, and the approval is
pinned to its content hash, so a changed skill needs approval again (D28).

## Provider runtime

The live backend agent implementation and its event stream. Desktop turns cross [AgentController][25]. Codex, Claude, Grok, Kimi, and OpenCode Go use Isnadi's Mastra Core controller, custom workspace and MCP tools, exact-instance server-owned access, and normalized Mastra runtime events. Standard OpenCode remains the explicit compatibility runtime because its API exposes an OpenCode-owned agent session rather than a raw model transport. The adapter contract is [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and the overview is in [providers.md][16].

#### Provider

The backend agent runtime that actually performs work. Six drivers ship built in: Codex, Claude, Grok, Kimi For Coding, OpenCode, and OpenCode Go. See [ProviderService.ts][14], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [OpenCodeAdapter.ts][17] as a representative adapter.

#### Session

The live provider-backed runtime attached to a thread. Session shape is in [the orchestration contracts][1], and lifecycle is managed in [ProviderService.ts][14].

#### Runtime seam

The single bridge where Promise-based code (Mastra callbacks, tool handlers, library promises) re-enters AgentController's Effect runtime. Its fibers belong to the controller's layer scope, so background failures are logged and shutdown interrupts in-flight work. See the runtime seam section of [providers.md][16].

#### Runtime mode

The safety/access mode for a thread or session. [The contracts][1] define four values: `approval-required`, `auto-accept-edits`, `auto`, and `full-access`. See [permission modes][18].

#### Interaction mode

The agent interaction style for a thread. Only `default` is in use. [The contracts][1] still accept the retired `plan` value so older stored threads, commands, and proposed plans decode, but clients no longer offer plan mode.

#### Assistant delivery mode

Controls how assistant text reaches the thread timeline. In [the contracts][1], `streaming` updates incrementally and `buffered` accumulates text. Buffered delivery is not held until the turn completes: it spills once accumulated text would exceed 24,000 characters, and flushes at approval and user-input boundaries. See [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Snapshot

A point-in-time view of state. The word is used in multiple layers, including orchestration, provider, and checkpointing. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Model routing

The path a bot's saved model takes to its provider. On `thread.turn.start` the decider rewrites the
command's `modelSelection` from the responding bot's engine, Mastra drivers map the slug to a wire
id such as `openai/<model>` or `anthropic/<model>` and call `session.model.switch`, and standard
OpenCode re-sends `modelSelection` per turn through the legacy bridge. Validation fails closed at
`bot.create`/`bot.update`, at turn-start preflight in `ws.ts`, and at `AgentController.inspectEngine`,
and all three only trust a provider snapshot that reports `status === "ready"`. See
[providers.md](./providers.md#model-routing) and
[provider-model-routing.md](../operations/provider-model-routing.md).

#### Model reroute

A runtime report that the provider served a different model than the one requested. Adapters emit
the `model.rerouted` runtime event and ingestion projects a `model.rerouted` activity line so the
change is visible. Today only the Codex adapter emits it. See
[providers.md](./providers.md#model-routing).

#### Model catalog

The per-driver model list, display names, and current-versus-legacy classification, built from models.dev. Bundled at `apps/server/src/provider/model-catalog.json` and refetched hourly by the server, so new models reach clients without a release. Replaces the older model manifest, which pre-catalog builds still read from `main`. See the [provider architecture][16] model catalog section.

### Checkpointing

Checkpointing captures workspace state over time so the server can diff turns and restore earlier points. Clients no longer include a diff review panel; the server still captures checkpoints and turn summaries. The main pieces are [CheckpointStore.ts][19], [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint

A saved snapshot of a thread workspace at a particular turn. In practice it is a hidden Git ref in [CheckpointStore.ts][19] plus a projected summary from [ProjectionCheckpoints.ts][21]. Capture and lifecycle work happen in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Checkpoint ref

The durable identifier for a filesystem checkpoint, stored as a Git ref. It is typed in [the contracts][1], constructed in [Utils.ts][22], and used by [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Checkpoint baseline

The starting checkpoint for diffing a thread timeline. This flow is surfaced through [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13], coordinated in [CheckpointReactor.ts][6], and supported by [Utils.ts][22].

#### Checkpoint diff

The difference between two checkpoints. On-demand diffs stay as patches; automatic turn summaries use NUL-delimited Git numstat. Query logic lives in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], summary parsing lives in [Diffs.ts][23], and finalization is coordinated by [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Turn diff

The file patch and changed-file summary for one turn. It is usually computed in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], represented in [the contracts][1], and recorded into thread state by [projector.ts][4].

## Practical Shortcuts

- If you see `requested`, think "intent recorded".
- If you see `completed`, think "result applied".
- If you see `receipt`, think "async milestone signal, for tests".
- If you see `checkpoint`, think "workspace snapshot for diff/restore".
- If you see `quiesced`, think "all relevant follow-up work has gone idle".
